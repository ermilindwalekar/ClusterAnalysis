# ClusterAnalysis

This project aims at finding and analysing clustering solutions (optimal) obtained by k-means/k-medoids on the bases of different measure such as distance function, number of clusters, cluster size. We will also focus on cluster stability as the above-mentioned algorithms are not completely deterministic and can depend on the initial (typically randomly determined) starting points. The dataset used here is HouseVotes84 which includes votes for each of the U.S house of representativeâ€™s congressmen on 16 key votes given as V1 to V16 with 435 observation.
